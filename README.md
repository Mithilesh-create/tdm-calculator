# Project title and description

Traffic Demand Management (TDM) calculator tool. DTLA Hack for LA is partnering with Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) to develop this tool to help planners at LADOT and real estate developers calculate how to meet some of Los Angelesâ€™s Mobility Plan 2035 goals. 

### Project context

[LA Mobility Plan 2035](https://planning.lacity.org/documents/policy/mobilityplnmemo.pdf)

Civic projects often exist within a larger context that may include multiple stakeholders, historic relationships, associated research, or other details that are relevant but not _required_ for direct contributions. Gathering these details in one place is useful, but the ReadMe isn't that place. Use this section to [link to a Google Doc](#) or other documentation repository where contributors can dig in if they so choose. This is also a good place to link to your Code of Conduct.

### Technology used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node
- Express
- React
- Microsoft SQL Server

- Each platform or framework should get its own bullet.
- Each platform should include an [active link](#) to the official documentation.

# How to contribute

Explain the different ways people can contribute. For example:

- Join the team {on Slack/at our weekly hack night/etc}.
- To help with user research, {do ABC}.
- To provide design support, {do XYZ}.
- To contribute to the code, see [Contributing.md](./Contributing.md)

Remember to provide direct links to each channel.

### Working with issues

- Explain how to submit a bug.
- Explain how to submit a feature request.
- Explain how to contribute to an existing issue.

To create a new issue, please use the blank issue template (available when you click New Issue). If you want to create an issue for other projects to use, please create the issue in your own repository and send a slack message to one of your hack night hosts with the link.

# Contact info

Include at least one way (or more, if possible) to reach your team with questions or comments.
